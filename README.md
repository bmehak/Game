# Game
HOLA AMIGOS!!!
We have made a water shooter game...
 interface ,button and gaame contain the code for our game
 rest others are the jpg and png files required for our game to run.
 We need to run the interface program file and then it automatically uses and calls other program files (button and gaame)
